        A Supreme Court justice and a trailblazing sports icon; the Godfather of Soul and the King of Wakanda: Chadwick Aaron Boseman couldn’t seem to help playing characters who were exceptionally, almost impossibly larger than life. 
        But the actor, who died Friday, August 28, 2020 at the age of 43 after a four-year battle with colon cancer, always appeared to wear the mantle of those roles as lightly as any man could. “It’s not like I’m necessarily looking for important Black figures,” he told EW in 2017 on the eve of his Thurgood Marshall biopic Marshall. “Like James Brown, it just kept calling to me at a certain point when I was saying no; it was like James Brown was calling me himself. And Jackie Robinson, there was no way in the world I wasn’t going to do that.” 
        And so Boseman embraced the challenge, working ceaselessly — even in times when the storytelling or the circumstances around him fell short — to find the living, breathing men beneath the burnished icons he so often played.
